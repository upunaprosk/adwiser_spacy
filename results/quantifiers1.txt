Besides, we can see, that both means of transport carry a small amount of chemicals (12% - part of rail transportation, 16 - part of road carrying).
Nowadays many people believe that modern technologies which are popular around the world and us of it with leads humanity to serious problems with health and amount of this problems is increasing every day.
These pressure could be a main reason of so dangerouse desease as cancer, which often leads to death.
Manufactured goods in this two pie charts is near to twenty five per-cents of all pie.
The biggest part of them took that problem because spend a lot of time at the computer.
If IT-technology takes a lot of time of their life they must choose production with less bad influence.
The amount of non-metallic minerals transported by road is twice bigger than by rail.
The amount of manufactured goods transported by road is practically the same as by rail.
The same amount of chemicals and food products are transported by rail (11 per cent).
While the smallest amount of goods transported by road is machinery.
Next, on the diagramm №1 we see that manufactured goods - 25%and it is almost equile quantity manufactured goods transported by road.
We can live without it, but now it is the part of our life and it will be very difficult and we will spent for easy things a lot of our time.
Some doctors say that it is because human spend a lot of time under the laptop.
Then follows the amount of manufactured goods.
It depended on materials and types of goods because various cargo should be transported by different ways.
A big amount of people whos eyes became to see worse.
As it known lorrys and trucks more flexible and faster than trains owe to this advantages main part of perishable goods are transported by road.
Moreover, lots of people which are working in Moscow subway are influenced by this radio-waves everyday and the last federal report of Ministry of healt shows that 80% of subway employee regulary experience headace and pain in inner organs.
Counting the fact that 4 billions people in the world use computer and smartphone everyday we can conclude that technologys killing us softly but surely.
In addition, it is clearly that the same trend is seen in transporting metals, this products transported by road is about one third of products transported by rail.
To begin with, these two diagramms show us the statistics of transportation of goods between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.
A lot of bad-influenced factories are situated in towns with a great amount of people.
The goverement should pay more attention to this problems.
Its percentage equals 35%, but in road transporting, metals have only 11% of whole amount of goods.
This dreams are making our brain tired.
But in the same time frequent using of this modern devices leads to people's ilnesses which should be cured.
It is not a secret that modern technologies affect these problem a lot - people do not have active lifestyle and spent a lot of time indoors with their gadgets.
It should be noted, that these social and health problem have many possible solutions.
Firstly, if consider this diseases chronologically, it is reasonable to name obesity as one of the oldest problems claimed to be caused by usage of television and computers.
Generally, this statistics says that some types of goods are mostly transported by trains and some by LGUs, HGUs, motor lorries etc.
The chart also allows to compare amount of goods delivered by motorized vehicles or by rail transport in each category.
The most remarkable parts of the chart show amount of metals transportation and food products by railroads and roads.
It is considered that rapidly increasing amount of technologies integrated to our everyday life is not safe for the people's health.
Sometimes this data illustrates considerably terrible processes and problems.
To be more exact, Japanese society is facing this problem nowadays as several amount of japanese choose being "trapped" in their apartments getting supplies through some services and refusing to contact the outer world.
First of all, there is no denying the countries' population should have enough food to survive and comfortably live.
However, there are people who think that to import food other countries is not fair according to their own population because they do not get enough food themselves.
First of all, producing a lot of food and other goods help plants and manufacturers to improve the quantity of workplaces.
But I don't consider these arguments really strong and in these case I disagree with such point of view.
I absolutely agree with this opinion for the several reason.
All of these offer to many people works, and prospects for rapid career progress.
In conclusion, it can be said that counries must offer opportunities for their own population to buy local goods and services and try to buy or import less things and resourses, because it makes them depended from others.
Similarly, the average pf minimum temperature flactuated between 28 degrees C° and 25 degrees C° with the minimum number of temperature of 18 degrees C° in July.
According to this logic people of all the countries should only eat what their countries can produce.
At this pictures we can be selecting and reporting the main features of climate in Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro.
Firstly, Some countries have not enough food to feed their own population because of climate, economical situation and other problems.
And the main type of getting and producing food for such countries is export enough from others.
Thecondly if countries will not produce the-food that their own population eats and will rake a much time and during this time the countries can produce this foods their own population eats.
The percentage of metals transported by railroads is 35% of all the cargo transported by rail in 2008 in the region, while the amount of metals transported by roads is substantially lower - it is only 12% of the goods transported by roads.
The least temperatures that we can see from the table is less than -40°C and it was in Yakutsk in January when in Rio de Janeiro the lowest temperatures was betwee 20°C and 25°C.
Moreover some of abroad food often doesn't have enough quality because it move to our country too late.
Sometimes goverment produce food for over countries that's why thay need to produce less products for their own needs and this is involve on people who live in their country because they don't have much food as they need to.
They haven't got enough food, so in my opinion, rich countries should help them.
Producing the food helps country to earn a lot of money and to build successfull economy.
I have already mentioned a lot of reasons: humanity (help for poor countries), gastronomic benefits (uniques products from all over the world) and financial advantages (import - allowes to earn a lot of money).
Due to that local factories and other industrial creations are able to raise the level of produced goods and services.
For example, chineese people eat a lot of rise and cook almost all dishes with rise because in China there are a conveniant wether conditions to plant it.
In this way, government wasted a lot of money to transportation and other aspects.
And there is a huge amount of pluses.
This two graphs illustrate the highest and the lowest temperatures in each month of the year in Siberian city Yakutsk (Russia) and the capital of carnavals Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).
With this knowledge we can compair this two graphs.
Firstly, countries spend a lot of money on the food's import, whereas they can produce product for the population by their own.
Nonetheless there are a lot of situation, when such things became uncontrol and even it is known there are bad ends.
Government should give enough money in oder to scientist can check better their inovations.
As is given, in Russia the minimum and the maximum numbers of the weather are the same, in January and December, there is about -35 and -40, respectively.
There are some people who consider that countries should produce the food for their own customers.
That's why the population can suffer from these chemical adds and have many deseases.
Import and export are the main processes of the Market; however, same people share belief, that, in terms of food industry, the numbers and amounts of both import and export are heavily exaggorated.
In conclusion, despite some advantages of producing the food for native people, I mostly disagree with the statement because of the impact that world trade has on the economy in different countries and the lack of the products in countries where it is impossible to grow enough food for population which can lead to the hungry and unsatisfaction nation.
I agree that countries only need to produce the food because the level of economy of different countries is not high and the government can not give own people enough food, for example, in Africans country.
For this reason we can see a situation when any countries have a huge number of some product and they need money, at the same time other countries need this product and their goverments have to buy it.
In conclusion I want to say, that countries all over the world should aim to import and export as big as possible and to produce not only the food that their own population eats, but different populations of the people all over the world.
Modern countries produce a lot of food for their citizens or for export and it is no the news.
There are some opportunities to decrease spending money and increasing the numbers of workforce.
Some people assume this countries should import products as little as possible what means that country choose the direction to consume only products, made in their country.
On the other hand, some products could not be made or grown in the particular country, but this products are really needed by country's consumers.
Moreover, less factories will be in the country that provide food only for people who live in it.
However, it could cause economical problems because there will much less places to work at.
After that figures fall to their winter states.
But we should use this products in our meal because it give us usedful vitamins and minerals.
Some cities, especially the big ones, get enough amount of food, others such as small villages, feel the lack of goods.
To sum up, the main difference between this graphs is that Yakutsk has cold winter and the highest temperature during the summer is average - maximum temperature in Brazil during the summer and autumn season.
We can grow fish and tea, so we will not be hungry, but other country will be, because they have a lot of gas, but cant grow food.
For example, I may need to eat lots of fish and what should I do if my country doesn't produce it and stopped even to import?
To sum up, these two pie charts demonstrate the different rations in their category, however, these graph have some type of goods, that had almost equal persantage in both the goods transported by rail and the goods transported by road.
The charts compare the amount of goods that was transported by rail and by road.
Overall, in 2008 it was a tendation to use rail way transport in order to relocate industrial stuffs like metals or machinery, while roads were used in order to remove less industrial guilds, like nutrition products or chemicals ones.
Totally, young generation should be restricted in amount of usage computers or internet until particular age.
If we compare this pie charts we can see that manufactured goods are transported by both means of transport.
There are different ways of solving this problems.
Chemicals had nearly equal numbers in both cases and it is also presented that road transport moved around 2 times higher amount of non-metallic minerals than rail transition (1,3% and 6%, accordingly).
To sum up, the technological progress which can be observed now, despite on the privileges it brings, is one main reasons for physical, sensitive and psychological health problems of population.
Nevertheless, it can be overcomed by focusing humans attention on this problems by government and by establishing more sport facilities and event without payments.
The pie charts compares the amount of goods which was delivered by trains and cars between countries in Eastern Europe in a year of 2008.
Besides, Chemicals were delivered by both ways with simillar amount of this goods with 11 and 16 percents.
The pie charts depict the amount of commodities transported by rail and road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.
It can be observed from the first chart that the metals consisted the large amount of goods (35%), manufactured goods consisted one fourth of all things transported by rail.
There are many of these health problems and several ways have been created in order to overcome that issues.
Procceding to the health problems, different kind of technology cause with various kind of human's diseases, which can lead to death or loose functions of organs.
For example, computer and other devices can cause an addiction which makes people completely lose the track of time when entering this technological imaginary worlds.
Some people believe that modern technology are the reason of numerous quantity of health problems.
It caused by huge amount of devices around us .
All modern gadjets have microwaves and this waves have harmful effect on our health.
While it's certain that some people turn to crime simply because they stumbled upon an opportunity to do so and seemingly get away with it, for a large number of people crime was a desperate, last-resort measure.
It can be deduced from the graph that the world from 2009 to 2011 the world total investment showes-d steady growth from 168 billions to 279 billions, making approximately two-time increase.
Similarly, the investment in developed countries showed growth from 100 billions to 150 billions from 2009 to 2011.
Speaking about developing countries, the investment showed growth from approximately 30 billions in 2006 to 100 billions in 2012, making three-times increase.
Secondly, there are less taxes and charges for companies, making the production of their goods more cheap.
Thirdly, developing countries have fewer laws about the environment and all kinds of pollution, which helps companies produce their goods with less losses.
However, the amount of people using Facebook on their desktop device decreased slightly from 150 to just over 130 million.
It makes a lot of sense, even I would never decide to commit burglary if there was a chance I could land in jail for 10 rather than 2 years, for instance.
Thirdly, in this case more goods will be present in small or poor countries and because of this people there can live better and have wider choice.
We can see that amount of users chatting on Facebook using a computer in 2012 and 2013 is practically equal with 150 millions of users in 2012 and about 130 millions in 2013.
In 2013 the popularity of mobile has risen from about 60 millions of people to about 100 of users.
The world total level of investment in renewable energy has rose up rapidly in 2009, reached the peak in 2011 and gone down in 2013, ending with the investment level of 214 billions of dollars.
The slightest difference is reached in 2013 with difference of 40 billions, comparable with 2010, when the difference in investment was the most dramatic - nearly 70 billion dollars.
Furthermore, in 2006 the level of investment in both developed and developing countries was less than 80 billions, comparable to 2013 with the maximum of 130 billions in developed countries.
They do not get enough sleep, the conditions they work at do not correspond to stated norms and rules.

To be more exact, Japanese society is facing this problem nowadays as several amount of japanese choose being "trapped" in their apartments getting supplies through some services and refusing to contact the outer world.

The line graph illustrates how changes the amount of profits of Apple, Samsung, Blackberry and HTC for the period of five years.
The main reason is that prices for goods are highso it is necessary for families to have enough money to buy these products.
Education of children is also expensive and parents always pay a lot of money for it.
Children spend a lot of time in, for example, kindergarden and take a wide range of habits from other children.
By contrast, profits of HTC and Blackberry fell during this years and Samsung income were the same level in 2015 as in 2010.
It is easy to find some problems that caused by this reasons.
Firstly, children and their parents have no trusting relationships because they don’t spend enough time to gether.
To sum up, when parents and their children don’t spend enough time together their family starts to destroy.
However, such choices lead to situations, when children do not spend enough time with their parents, and it causes following problems.
Generally speaking, the total amount of such children decreased in every region.
The most dramatic changes took place in South Asia, where the number of these children fell down by more then 3 times form 32,7 millions to 9,9 which is the lowest rate in 2012.
The price on the small amount of tickets that will still be on the market will be too high and nearly noone will be able to afford them.
It was counted by 43,7 millions children.
In 2012 the number of uneducated children had gone down to 32,7 millions.
The second place in number of uneducated children in 2000 year took South Asia with 32,7 millions.
But in 2012 it dramatically gone down to 9,9 millions.
Rest of World’s number in 2000 year is 23,3 millions.
And this number fell down to 15,3 millions to 2012.
The gender in all this regions is practically same.
The graph represents the amount of boys and girls during the period from 2000 to 2012 in different regions who were not able to access the primary school.
According to the chart the greatest number of children without access to primary education was in Africa in 2000 year (more than 43 millions).
First of all, according to the statistic much more poisonous gas and exhaust fumes are produced by cars, due to this fact it will be more useful to introduce more laws for reducing amount of cars which is constantly rising nowadays.
Moreover, reducing the amount of air flights will cause some kind of economic crises for air flight companies and influence the number of people who will start use their private transport such as cars, and using of trains and ferries is also will increase.
However, this kinds of transport produce more waste in the atmosphere.
As a result, this laws for reducing air travel will not be effective and useful for the environment and will lead to crisis.
We are given a bar chart which provides us with information about the changes in the amount of children who have not an opportunity to be educated in primary school in different regions such as Africa, South Asia and the rest of the world.
First of all, the main feature is that the amount of boys and girls without primary school educations decreased in all regions between 2000 and 2012.
The best decrease was registrated in South Asia from 32,7 millions children to 9,9 millions.
Introduction of this laws will probably cause negative moods in the socity.
Obviously, the least number of children with no access to school education belongs to South Asia: 4,8 millions of boys and 5,1 millions of girls got left with no education in 2012.
The least changes are found in Africa: the number of boys with no education fell for 20 per cent approximately, while in case with girls there is a decrease for 30 per cent roughly.
The chart provides the information about the change in the amount of children, who don’t have an access to primary school education in twelve years period by sex and region.
Furthermore, these twelve year have witnessed a great downward trend, especially in Asia, where the quantity of girls without access to primary education has become four times less, and number of boys just about two times less.
At the first glance, it is obvious that in less economically developed regions children are more likely not to get a chance to go to school.
It was 43,7 millions of people.
Besides, in 2012 Africa did not lose its position and counted 32,7 millions of children without an education, which was still the biggest number by this time.
That number is 9,9 millions.
The biggest difference was noticed in South Asia in 2000, where twice more uneducated girls than boys and that variable was 21,6 millions.
It is obvious that all these transport can be as damaging for the nature, as planes do, or maybe ever more.
The most obvious change has occured in South Asia with a fall form 21,6 millions of girls and 11,1 millions of boys in 2000 to 4,8 and 5,1 millions correspondingly.
The number of girls without education reduced from 23,7 to 18,2 millions.
Also 5,5 millions more of african boys 2012 could have an opportunity to study than in 2000.
Some people claim that travelling by air leads to environmental problems, so governments should prohibit such an enormous amount of flights.
By reducing a huge amount of flights some really serious problems with transportation may occure.
As it can be seen from the bar chart, there was only approximately 10 millions of children without the access to education in 2012 in South Asia in comparison to about 35 millions in 2000 which means that there used to be almost 3,5 more children unable to enter school in 2000 than 2012.
Speaking about Africa, there was a slight improvement in decreasing the number of children with no access to primary schools: almost 5 millions more girls and just over 5 millions of boys were able to get education in 2012 results: the general number insignificantly decreased while boys and girls shares remained stable.
The bar chart illustrates changes in the amount of children without access to primary school education during the period of 13 years (2000-2012) by sex and region.
It has fallen by 18,2 millions girls and 14,5 millions boys in 2012.
The most dramatic change have happened in South Asia, where the fall in number of kids was approximately 26 millions: from 2000 to 2012.
This dynamic has resulted in the fact that South Asia has less children without chance to have primary school education that in the other regions.
There is a widely spread opinion that government structures should control the number of air travel by the power of law, but from my personal point of view it is not the most effective solution to this problem.
First of all, although it is true that in our time we have a huge amount of unnecessary air travel incidents, it could be very difficult to establish an international law that will control the number of flights.
The chart illustrates the amount of children, which are do not have an opportunity to get education in primary school from 2000 by gender and areas.
From the first glance, it is clear that Africa took the first place in the amount of children, which cannot be educated in primary schools.
That was only 10 millions.
The highest mark of the number of children without any primary education available was noticed in Africa with 20 millions of boys and 23,7 millions of girls, respectively, making for an insignificant difference between genders in 2000.
Both regions experienced a steady decrease of, approximately, 10 million adolescents over the period with the total of 33 millions and 15 millions for Africa and Rest of the World respectively.
My strong concern is that new regulations should be passed by authorities so as to out down on the amount of nonessential flights.
The greatest rise in the level of access happened in South Asia when approximately twenty three millions of children have got an opportunity to study.
For example, in South Asia the number of such boys was approximately two times bigger – almost twenty one and a half millions versus almost eleven millions.
They are ten millions of kids in Africa, eight millions – in the rest of the world and the most significant changes happened in South Asia where the gap redused for approximately twenty three millions of children.
As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure.
It has already been concluded by scientists that aircraft produces too much CO2 emissions and destroys our environment.
The graph illustrates the amount of children who do not have the opportunity, to go to school in a period of time from the year 2000 to 2012 by sex and geographic location.
So nearly 45 millions of children could not afford education in 2000 in Africa and more than half of that number is established by girls – 23,7 millions to 20 millions of boys.
This proportion is even more in the South Asia in the same year – 21,6 millions girls compared with 11,1 millions of young men.
In the rest of the world situation was the same in 2000 – 12,8 millions girls to 10,5 millions boys.
So, in South Asia and the rest of the world the proportion between uneducated boys and girls became almost the same at that time – 4,8 millions of girls to 5,1 millions boys and 7,6 millions of girls to 7,7 millions of boys.
All in all, we can see that the amount of uneducated children falls down each year and girls now have nearly the same opportunities for studying as boys do.
Shipping cargo and the passengers by airplanes leads to polluting the atmosphere and the raise of temperature all over the world, so must be taken laws for the reducing the number of air travel for business and tourism activities.
Carbon dioxide which is thrown in the atmosphere by planes causes global warming and ice melting and planes produce most of it, so less planes means less pollution.
They claim that for same undeveloped countries tourism is the only way of earning the money as for the businessman as for the government budget, so by these eco-laws the economics will crush in logistics, tourism and other sectors, but they forget that our planet’s resources are not timeless and now we face the problem of the existing of our environment which is more important than the economy.
However, this increase has then followed by a drop in 2013, when the percentage reached the number of 60%.
Although in the period of 2013-2015 Samsung's share of profits decreased more than twice to the number of 15%.
To understand this trend in a more deep way it is important to take a closer look at the reasons of this phenomena and at the possible problems in can cause.
Then, children feel not enough love and support from their parents and may unconsiously reproduce such family model in future, raising the generalizations of underloved individuals.
According to the chart, almost 24 and 20 millions of boys and girls in Africa did not have access to primary school education in 2000, whereas the number of children without primary education in South Asia was slightly more that 21 and 11 millions for girls and boys respectively in the same year.
Twelve years later this number declined by nearly 5 and 3 millions for girls and boys living in the rest of the world respectively.
On the other hand, in order to raise a child one needs to work as a lot of money is needed.
It is easy to see that in 2000 the biggest number of uneducated children held place in Africa with almost 45 millions of people, whilst in the rest of the world was the smallest with only 23 millions.
By the time passed the situation has dramaticaly changed for all of the given regions - the biggest difference seemed to be in South Asia as the number plummeted from 32 millions to 10, which was the lest result in 2012 in comparison to other places.
They are not so strict (as a rule) and a child may spend a lot of time in front of the tv or computer screen, which is badly for health.
To sum up, the main reasons why both of the parents work is the necessity to get money and a carreer willings.
For example, the transport systems work faster, so people are expected to move quicker and fulfill the huge amount of different tasks which also results in the lack of time to spend with family.
Overall, the situation on the global smartphone market tended to change many time but the leader company stayed the same.
Unfortunately, it affects their children as they do not have enough time for spending it on something else but work.
In 2012 there was a decrease by 5% in amount of boys not visiting primary schools and the same trend was observed for girls.
The most dramatic change was in south Asia where number of children without access to primary schools dropped from 32,7 millions to 9,9 millions and reached the lowest number.
To sum up I would like to note that air travel has to be reduced in order to improve ecological situation and first of all in the aim of government, because people are not consious enough and do not have enough power to make such serious decisions.
During this period it had had a little decrease from 43,7 millions to 32,7.
In the 2000 in South Asia number of children without primary education was also very high - 32,7 millions.
After 12 years situation has changed a lot and in the 2012 we can see equal quantity of boys and girls, total number was 9,9 millions.
In the Rest of World in the 2000 were 23,3 millions of such children and more girls than boys (12,8 with 10,5).
In the 2000 Africa had the biggest amount of non-educated children and Rest of the World - the lowest.
You couldn't travel to other part of the Earth not by plane, it will take you a lot of time, great part of your life.
The graph illustrates how the overall amount of children not able to get education in primary school and its ratio by genders in the three regions changed in 12 years.
The most succesful company, according to the graph, is Apple, which obtained 70% of smartphone profits in 2010 and then constantly rised it’s share in global amount of profits share slightly decreased due to the growing of Samsung’s share.
However, such choices lead to situations, when children do not spend enough time with their parents, and it causes following problems.
The number of male and female shoulb be equal in every subject in universities.
I agree with position about accepting equal numbers of male and female.
In conclusion, I would like to say that universities make right choise, when accept equal number of male and female in every subject, but it is not availible now, case of the general population of male and female is not the same.
The data below demontstrates the proportion of population among citizens of age 65 and over in Japan, Sweden and the United States during one handrend years (1940-2040).
Never the less, he amount of old citizens will slightly accrease in 2020'sand then it will comes to its peak of 25 percents in 2040.
To sum it up, I would like to say that the idea of acceptance the same amount of male students as a female in university seems to has no sense.
The graph presents data connected with the percentage estimation of amount of people of age 65 and more from three different countries in the selected period of time between 1940 and 2040.
Than amount of such people in the USA sharply rised up to 15% and then levelled off till 2020.
Nowadays, there is an urgent problem connected with the argument whether it is necessary for universities to allocate proportional amount of male and female students in every discipline.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that both man and woman should be able to choose their subject independly and the amount of people to every discipline by no means should be determined by universities.
Some people believe that there must be as much female students as male students in every subject.
In comporison with middle-ages, it could be said that women have as much rights as men, or even more.
However, they want more and more - in some countries women want to get as much places in government as men, or enforce universities to accept equal numbers of male and female students.
However, that doesn't mean that female students shouldn't be accepted for these courses - if they have enough knowledge and intention to study these subject why don't they be accepted?
To sum up, we can say that people in this countries become older and in the future there will be less young people and as a result it will be less people who can work in effective way.
The second argument may be that in such situation, when the amount of male and female students in every faculty is equal everybody will ful comfortable because there will not be a majority of girls, for instance, and it will be easier for everybody to communicate and find friends.
Some people claim that universities should accept equal amount of male and female students in every subject.
Inspite of this facts, graphic shows suggested tendency of dramut: cully increasing proportion for all of three countries.
Although I am convinced that manicind cannot tolerate with discrimination between genders, I suppose, that setting up the equal numbers of male and female in every subject is incorrect, because this approach would not take info account some important conditious and will lead to greater discrimination.
The graph shows difference between amount of 65 ages citizens in per cent from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA.
Countries in 1940 included only 5-10% of old people (65 years and over); but recearchers suppose that amount of this people in population of countries will be about 20-30% to 2040.
The topic of difference between male and female in different spheres of studing is very important in modern world, because nowadays question of equal rights and opportunities is topical for large amount of people and organization.
Obviously, girls are able to take knowledge about this subjects but they cannot to work and use their knowledge in practice.
To sum up, the general idea of modern education is not equal amount of girls and boys but is iqual access to this education!
All in all the graph shows, that the amount of people aged 65 and over is not static between 1940 and 2040, it changes dramatically and in whole is going up.
As for me, it does not matter how many male or female students are in studying group, but it is clearly, that universities should offer equal amount of places for boys and girls.
Of course, there are several reason, why boys usually choose other kind of proffession, than girls.
The most amount of changes connected with proportion of population in Sweden.
I know there is a common opinion that the most amount of men are mathematics and think more logical, among of them there is a plenty of great scientist.
That's because men have much possibilities than women.
The percentage of population aged 65 and over in USA is guaducelly increasing during this 100 years like in Sweden.
As a result of this equality students lose their ability for competition.
What is more, population also need to be taken into account, as in some countries, the number of women prevaile.
The line graph gives an information about the amount of people over 65 years old basing on the statistic data of three countries: Japan, Sweden and the United States of America.
According to the graph, the amount of people from the presented age group in Japan steadily fell in the period from 1940 to 1985.
The amount of such people in the United States slightly increased from 9% to 15% in the period from 1940 to 1980.
Besides, it can be seen from the life, that men are good at one aspects and women are the best in other questions.
However, if was equal amount of male and female students, it can easy to work in pare.
Taking all these facts into consideration my conclusion is that equal number of male and female student in every subject is possible but there is no practical benefit.
The graph presents the changing of the amount of people aged 65 during a centure since 1940 till 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA.
But should universities accept equal amount of boys and girls?
Less boys are interested in low, more girls become judges, lawyers, prosecutors etc.
First of all, population of this people in Japan was the most little from 1940 to 2030.
As aresult, we can name the same dinamic of increasing proportion of the population aged 65 and over in this countries.
This graph shows us, that qualer of the population is old people, and borning was decling or level of life in this countries was increasing.
There is opinion, that universities should have equal amount of male and female students in every subject in society.
For example, on low faculty, only girls like family law, and it is imposible to have equal numbers of male and female on this subject.
Secondly, to my mind, level of education doestn depend from equal amount of boys and girls.
There are a lot of wrong opinion about universities'es education in society, and this theory is one of them.
But some persons consider that the institutes should accept the equal amount of girls and boys in every faculty.
That's why these faculty accept only male.
To sum it up I can say that I completely agree with the statement that the universities should not accept the strong established member of students (equal amount of male and female).
The graph illustrates the amount of people aged 65 and under over the period of 100 years between 1940 and 2040.
After that numbers of Japan started to decline slowly.
Some people believe that equal amount of boys and girls should be accepted in every faculty.
In conclusion, I'd like to say that many menmanymindsbutI think that we should change education conditions in this way because today we have a lot of more serious problems to deal with.
Most students have enough free time to do this with no destroy of studing.
In 2040 the number of population aged 65 and over reached a peak.
Implementation of that requirement will not be effective and number of male and female student is unlikely to become equal in every subject.
The amount of elderly people living in Japan, Sweden and the USA in different years is given on the data presented.
Probably, such a suggestion is reffered by people to the point that the number of male in our population declines rapidly.
On my course, for instance, there is a great deal of girls than boys.
What is more, the government trough the universities cannot control an amount of people of each gender, studying definite subject.
So it could be unfair to accept equal numbers of male and female to study enjineering or programming.
It should be taken into qecunt that the situation when equal amount of girls and boys study one subject, what is the main issue, can never come true as it is impossible for state to regulate people's interests.
To start with, in the first 50 years (from 1940 to 1990) the changes of this proportions were rather similar in the USA and Sweden (both of them increased on =7%), while the same propotion in Japan fell (from 5% to 2,5%).
After that the percentage had various development in the all countries.
To begin with, I am in favour of such point of view that there is no neccesity in the establishing of this rules.
In each sector far less people after 50 have an intention to change the sphere where they work.
At this age, the children are still need a lot of time to play and they should use their time in primary school for it.
So that the elder people the less its number was working there as in 1998 as in 2006.
Besides that, the most noteworthy fact about 1998 is that in the dominant sector of education the biggest amount of employees were in a mature age and reach maximum in the baud of 45-56 years old, meanwhile as in all of her sectors the biggest amount of people accounted for the youngest or next young group by age.
In 2006 the amount of people engaged in the technology area soared in hundreds of times.
Thus it took a predominant position above all sectors referring to the first three age group and reached the maximum amount of employed people in the band of 26-35 years old.
I support the idea of that kids should begin learning foreign language as soon, as possible, because the faster they become familiar with a foreign language, the better they will know it in their future life.
Secondly, children at primary school have less problems than people in secondary school.
In building sector we can see the number of interested people are plummefed - in 1998 the amount of people from 26-35, who were involved in building was 79607 and in 2006 it becomes 46409 and we can notice this situation in every age.
Thirdly in technology we can see an extremely increasing the level of people that working in that areas was growing over 70 percent - 454375 people from 26 to 35, 19352 0 people from 56 to 65 and ofcourse young people - 187600.
In sectors hotel & catering and education the amount of workers are fluetuafed.
The number of this people are 21303 and the small group in this sector are people from 56 to 65 years, this fact illustrated that the small group in this sector from 1998 to 2006 years are people whose age group 56 years to 65 years.
On my opinion, when children start learning languages at primary school, they have more opportunities to develop their foregein skills than people who start learning foregein language at secondary school, because in secondary school children have a lot of home-work, than in primary and sometimes they don't want to learn foregein language.
But from the one hand, people who learn foregein language from primary school have a lot of positive fact, which they can use in their life, for example, they can read foregein books or magazines, watch foregein films.
There are not many different subject that are obligated to study by pupils and they may to spend more time for learning foreign language.
In conclusion, it should be said that there is no disadvantages of the chance to begin study foreign language earlier than in secondary school, because process of learning for children in the primarily school is more easier than in the secondary school, and, what is more, pupils in the primarily school have less subjects to study and consequently lot of time to study language.
To begin with the several trend are revealed by the graph.
In today's world of fierce competition people pay a lot of attention to the problem of children's education and development.
In secondary school they have much problems whith national language and other sudjects.
All in all, I think that learning forieng language is better in secondary school, than in primary, but, they need to learning both language in secondary school, because today people have globalization in all modern countries, which speak in many language.
This table presents us information about how much people of different age groups worked in different spheres of labour in the UK in 1998 and 2006.
The overall trend is that popularity of low-paid and requiring less skills work, as hotel or catering service and building fell steadily with growth of the age of employees both in 1998 and 2006.
Secondly, there is a tendenec to work 2 times less people in building area in the age from 18 to 35.
So, the begin time of study a second language is first of all question of parents, but teachers can also have a responsibility of these decision.
Some can do some think (as a learning a lot of new information by heart) and some couldn't.
The fewest number of people from 56 to 65 year works in technology.
We can argue that the reason is the old age and few energy for working.
What are this problems?
Skilled vocational diploma is the group with the biggest amount of men.
Finally, as can be seemed from the chart, amount of men, as a rule, more then amount of women in post-school qualification.
Nowadays there are many talants in all breanches of art, but all of this talanted people introduce themselfe in thair own way.
On the second place is postgraduate diplome and the amount of men who decided to get it is 70%.
However, there exists two types of education, where amount of women exceeded amount of men.
For many centuries art was an important part of our life.
Twice higher number of man have this in comparison with woman.
The next popular positions from men were postgraduates and master's degree, which percent were more than a half, but this qualifications were less popular from women and were not more than 50%.
Whereas, arts and crafts are gave enjoy for people around the world and gave many thing in national or world's culture.
In comparison with classic art, modern ideas links this politican, economic and life's problems.
There are many difference opinions about this works.
This essay will eximene different points of view on the free art and my opinion on the these theme.
The bar chart compares the numbers of popularity between males and fe-males whose chose the different directions in their profession in 1999 in Australia.
This figure is more than twice higher than the amount of males who decided to have a undergraduate diploma.
The number of man who chose a bachelor's degree was at about 45%.
It was an undergraduate diploma, at just over 70%, unlike the amount of women who chose a bachelor's degree, at nearly 55%.
On the other hands the smallest amount of women took skilled vocation diploma, it accounted for 10 percent.
And less men that women chose undergraduate diploma, it was about 38 percent.
In oppozite about 70% of women took Undergraduate diploma, and just 40 percent of men hold this qualifications.
It may be said that the Bachelor's degree has almost the same amount of females and males, but only has percentage of women little bit higher than men.
Others post school qualifications have a great amount of men a little level of women.
Their pictures may not be clearly understanded but all visitors can fell the energy of this works.
There is the proportion of male and female who held this qualifications in 1999.
Despite these fact, the amount of females with the vocational diploma is dramatic smaller then the mens.
The amount of people who have a higher degree of education is slightly smaller.
But in the same time the postgraduate diploma have only 30%, while these number among the men is accounted for 70%.
As can be seen from the chart most number of female held undergraduate diploma and this accounted of 70 percent but males held skilled vocational diploma.
According to bar chart the large amount of males held skilled vocational diploma.
We can understud it, because the post-schoot who give this degrees have the much little date percentage in the chart.
As can be seen from bar chart the skilled vocational diploma had the least percentages of females and a mere 10 per cent.
They think that this people can make unsosiate picture, music and films.
This ideas can take children more nervous and angree.
People who write music, make films must do the big job, this people find information and analist for people and peoples.
However, this people make sosiaty ideas, but sometimes this ideas do not friendly for sosiate ruls, but this ideas is not bad or good this things (music, cinema, picture) is different.
This ideas can be normally in the future.
As can been seen from the bar chart the highest number of female had such qualification as undergraduate diploma, about 70 per cent.
The Bachelor's degree and the Master's degree were got by less amount of women, about 40 and 55 per cent.
The bar chart presents various levels qualification of school in Australia and the proportion of male and female in 1999.
In 1999 amount of women skilled vocational diploma was 10 per cent.
Overall, this people, such have diffent ideas, for example: actors, urter, writer, sculptor.
The govenment don't take control on this people, because it might become terrible situatichs.
That make good environment for tipical creative people, let should don't touch they and give this people more spaces for various creative something.
They want doing that they want, because this people have mind, that distinguishes from mind of usual people, very unusual and emotional and the government schould let them to express their desires.
The majority amount of men chose the skilled vocational diploma.
The less amount of females wanted have skilled vocational diploma.
A lot of artist be nowaday.
A lot of information which tought bad things.
I think that goverment must controled this procces.
Much things can do the goverment.
Because only professor in this areas can choose those idea, which will be corectly.
The chart presentets how many woman and men have different a revelations education in Australia.
As we see from the graph the biggest amount of femails hold undergraduate diploma around 70%, meanwhile the highest percentage of mails chose skilled vocational diploma near 92%.
According to the chart the amount of femails was falling in percentage from bachelor's degree, then to master's degree, lower to postgraduate.
This people often have creative ideas and they want to show them.
Sometimes this ideas are not normal for other people.
In contrast, only 10% of women chosen this qualifications.
The presentage of women who had a postgraduate diploma accounted half of the presentage of men In conc conclusion, the majority of men had a skilled vocational diplomar, meanwhile the less women had it.
One people think, that creative people should not have any restrictions.
sometime political situation is the reason of many censorship.
On the second place is postgraduate diploma which held 20% less men than previous group.
And this figures are undergraduate diploma.
This people becomes very interesting, imaizing and wonderfull and people whants to be like him.
This people are very bad exampels for children and for the adults too.
And today the goverment nothing to do to stop this artists.
And the governement should to use any restrictions for this people.
We have many nice artist who did or do strange things, but people love them.
In conclusion, I want to say that I agree with people who want to bound their children and themselfs from this strange artists.
Females had the least level in this qualifications, it was about 10%.
In this essay I will analyse other aspects of this fenomen and releasing of goverment to this challenge.
And now when we have more right of freedom and less censors we feel better.
As every problematic question which raises such a huge discussions has at least two positions of view and lots of argumentation behind them.
Thus, owing to this quotes adjustement there would be a kind of discrimination, when women could easily enter a university and men - could not.
One of the most significant of them is that it is much easier to create a family, when there is an equal amount of male and female students at the one destination.
To achieve this goals, a lot of women want to study in the universities.
To my mind, of course it is better when in class there are the equal numbers of male and female, because it helps then to know each other better.
Another obvious fact is that the amount of men holding skilled vocational diploma hugely overtakes the number of women: about 90% for men and 10% for women.
Some people consider that equal numbers of male and female student should be accept in universities.
On the other hand, equal numbers of male and female in every subject cannot be accept by universities.
However, it is fluctuabive during the entire period, the amount of people of given age grow from about 7% in 1940 to 26% in 2040.
Secondly, it is always difficult to organize some student's events without having both boys and girls of the enough amount, the tasks in such situation are given for each persons to use this human's potential and characteristics.
If we have to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject it will to a lot of harm to this scientific and practical approach to studying these subjects.
The largest amount of males had skilled vocational diploma and it consist of 85%.
First one contents London, Paris and Tokyo where subway is widely used by passangers.
The most actively used underground railway station are located in Paris and Tokyo due to the fact that the amount of passengers in quite huge while their lenght are hot the biggest.
For example, musicians who are like to become great professionals but do not pay enough attention to rehearsals often do not show stellar results.
However, it's passenger density is not the biggest and it is less than half of the same parameter of Tokyo, where the number of passengers per year reaches 1927 millions.
The city of Koyoto seems to be an outsider it this comparison, as it has only 11 kilometers of tracks and, on average, no more than 45 million passengers of this means of transport between European countries and United States of America.
I sleek to the opinion of Jean-Paul Surtre and this ideas about existenuanneleum, which are absolutely opposite to the ones, introduced by Zigmund Freid.
The shortest subway system out of this cities is a Kyoto subway system.
At the same time the Washington DC subway system which was opened in 1976 with almost the same lenght of route as in Tokyo (126 kilometres compared to 155 kilometres) had more then 10 times less passengers a year( 144 million compared to 1927 million)It is a matter of common knowledge that trough out our life we face different life experiences: both positive and negative.
But it takes a lot of time to works in order to form your personality.
Overall, we can see that the newest undegrounds are shorter in kilometers of route and less citizens use them compared to railway systems which were built before 1981.
According to the table, the longest underground which is situated in London, while the most popular one is Tokyo metro if we take figure 1927 millions of people who use it during the year.
And the second city where the metro is also very popular is Paris where the amount of passengers reaches up to 1191 mil.
It is clear, that Kyoto and Los Angeles undegrounds railways system are the newest ones and so their kilometers of route are only 11 km and 28 km and amounts of passengers are 45 and 50 millions during one year.
As a result, less people today use the undegrounds which were built recently, preferring other kindes of transport.
Furthermore, despite the fact that in Tokyo underground system has only 155 kilometeres of route the amount of passengers is a bout 2000 millions.
In Koyoto and Los Angeles only 45 and 50 millions people use underground railways.
Next column shows the amount of kilometres of rate.
But unfortunately underground of London is not the most popular because the biggest amount of visitors (1927) has underground of Tokyo.
we didn't have personality at those moment.
We can see strong differences between Tokyo where is the amount of passengers is 1927 persons, however, in Koyoto is less in several times.
To sun up, the table shows that kilometres of route and the amount of passengers per year depend on date opened of railway system in every city.
As for Koyoto and Los Angeles, they were opened later and have much less kilometres of route.
Seconly, the maximum amount of passengers per year was in Tokyo (1927 million), compared to Koyoto, where this indicator reached the lowest number of 45 million.
Supporters of this they consider that only 20% of person's personality depends on his parents one and the child can inherit only some of their characteristics .
The biggest amount of visitors in Tokyo's underground railway system.
the smallest amount of passengers is in Koyoto and Los Angeles, 45 and 50 millions of visitors in the year.
These towns have more passengers in the year than other towns and have huge amount of kilometres of route.
To begin with, the little children, who was born one week ago or one month ago have different behaviours, they don't have any experiences in this periods of their lifes.
The underground route in London is by for the longest, while Tokyo subway provides the highest amount of oassengers by transport per year.
The first subway was opened in London in 1863, were 394 kilometres in route and was I pushed by 775 millions of people per year.
Tokyo railway, opened in 1927, was only 155 kilometres on route but, compare to previous system, helped to travel to almost 2000 millions passengers.
The Washington Dc system, opened in 1976, was 126 km in distance and had only 144 millions of passengers every year.
For Los Angeles figures were slightly better: 23 kilometres of route and 50 millions of people, using transport per year.
Overall, summarizing all the dats given, it is obvious that underground systems, founded between the second half of the 19th century and the first half of 20th centery, had more significant transport characteristics and until today may provide transport provide successful transportation for larger amounts of people, than much younger subways, founded in the last three decades of the 20th centuryNowadays many people are in a serious concern about their self-development and personal qualities.
In 3 of this catigories we can see a tendencee that there are more men than women (skilled vocational, postgraduate, and master's).
Secondly the table shows that Tokyo metro is much smaller and lower development than metro in London, but it takes 1927 millions passenger per year and this is because of in Tokyo population is much higher than in London .
However in the same time Washington DC metro has particularly the same size with Tokyo metro, but there are not so much passengers, Tokyo metro is really over crowded.
Though Paris and Tokyo underground railway system carry so much passengers every year their length is still around 2 times less than the one in London.
Talking about the amount of passengers per year I can say that it is not too big, in comparison with the amount in Tokyo.
We can see that the shorted route is in Koyoto, the length is just 11 kilometres and the amount of passengers is also the smallest there - just 45 millions per year.
I can also mention, that the underground system of Los Angeles, which is the youngest (it was opened just in 2002) is quite longer than Koyoto's system and has 28 kilometres of route, and the amount of passengers per year is 5 millions bigger.
It is notable to see that the majority of these underground railway system opened in a previous century except the subway systems in London (XIX century) and Los Angeles (XXI century).
The biggest amount of passengers in 1927 million people per year use Tokyo system, which is just 155 kilometres long.
Generally, all these cities provide 913 kilometres of route overall, and at the same time they are being able to service 4132 millions passengers per year.
However, the biggest capacity of railway system is Tokyo's - it is able to serve 1927 millions of passengers - while providing only 155 kilometres of railway.
Compared to the nearest competitor of Tokyo, - Paris, - the difference between the lenght of territory covevet with railways is 44 kilometres, but the difference in capacity of it is 726 millions passengers per year.
The most overcrowded subway system is located in Tokyo which is visited by 1927 millions people per year.
It is noticeable, that two underground railway systems which opened later that the cities service the least amount of passengers per year.
On contrary, the most significant amount of passengers is registered in Paris and Tokyo with 1191 and 1927 million of passengers per year respectively.
It is noticeable that even the oldest underground railway system, which emerged in London in 1863, has not researched such a high amount of passengers.
The highest rate of passengers per year is in Tokyo: about 1927 millions peoples on the 155 kilometres of route.
The next is London underground sistem which is also known as "tube" with 775 millions of passengers.
Then the huge gap, the Washington DC under ground system with 144 millions of passengers per year and quite long comparins to others 176 km route.
